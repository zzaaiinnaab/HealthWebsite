    <h4>Millions of people in the U.S. are affected by mental illness each year. It‚Äôs important to measure how common mental illness is, so we can understand its physical, social and financial impact ‚Äî and so we can show that no one is alone. These numbers are also powerful tools for raising public awareness, stigma-busting and advocating for better health care.</h4>

    <h3>Where can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
  Mental illnesses can affect persons of any age, race, religion, or income. Mental illnesses are not the result of personal weakness, lack of character or poor upbringing. Mental health conditions cannot be overcome through will power and are not related to a person‚Äôs character or intelligence, but they are treatable. Most people diagnosed with a serious mental illness can experience relief from their symptoms by actively participating in an individual treatment plan.<br>
